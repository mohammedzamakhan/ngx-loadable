# Contributing to ngx-loadable

Hello there. Thanks for taking time out to contribute to [ngx-loadable](https://github.com/mohammedzamakhan/ngx-loadable)!

We are open to any kind of contribution: code, documentation, bug-fixing (even just reports), feature-requests and anything else you may come up with.

## Getting started

### Roadmap

There's a (tentative) [roadmap](project-roadmap) in which we've put down what we envision to be the best-next functionalities.

Since the project is constantly evolving and new features are requested/discovered as we go, this roadmap is open for discussions and we expect it to change over time.

## Contributing

### Coding

Nothing fancy here, just:

1. Fork this repo
2. Run `npm install` to install the relevant modules
3. Run `npm run build:lib` to build the ngx-loadable library
4. Run `npm start` to serve the project
5. Do your magic! ✨
6. Commit you code
7. Submit a pull request. It will be reviewed by maintainers and they'll give you proper feedback so you can iterate over it.

Please note: Any contributions you make are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers this project.

#### Considerations

- Following [The seven rules of a great Git commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules) is highly encouraged
- When adding a new feature, branch from [master-branch](https://github.com/mohammedzamakhan/ngx-loadable/tree/master)

### Documenting

Code should be self-documented. But, in case there is any code that may be hard to understand, it must include some comments to make it easier to review and maintain later on.

### Reporting bugs

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
